# Al-Bot-3.0

## Setting Up

First, follow the instructions from [this guide](https://pythiauf.github.io/Triya-UF-OSC-Docs/guides/python_project.html).

After that, you'll need to make a bot application and add it to a server:
- [Discord.js has a good guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) on how to make a bot application. Make sure to save the token somewhere!
- [The guide right after that](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html) tells you how to invite the bot. This process will be formalized later, but for now, just make a test Discord server to use the bot in.

Then, you'll want to create a `.env` file in your base directory. Make it look something like this:
```
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```

You should be able to run the bot by running `main.py` after that!
